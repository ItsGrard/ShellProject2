# Shell Project
## Compiling and running instructions
Pretty easy,

Clone or download as .zip

Use WSL(I used this), a linux distro terminal or MacOS terminal to compile and run the code.

In the terminal, navigate to the folder where you have cloned / unzipped the code.

Then, run ```gcc Shell_project.c job_control.c job_control.h -o Shell``` to compile.

After compiling successfully, just type ```./Shell``` in the folder the code was compiled in and it'll be up and running.


*To install gcc compiler on Linux, WSL or MacOS terminal use* ```sudo apt-get install gcc```
